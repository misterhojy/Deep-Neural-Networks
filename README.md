This project is an introduction to deep learning. You will build and train simple DNN architecures for regression and multi-label classification using PyTorch. This assignment acts as a "Hello World!" program for you to enter into the realm of building, training and testing DNN architectures.

By the end of this assignment, you are expected to have a basic understanding of how to build and train DNNs for simple classification and regression tasks. This project will prepare you for upcoming domain specific ML problems that requires much complex architectures.
